Hi, my name is Jacob and welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio; a comprehensive exemplar of my background which applies to cybersecurity professional positions. Here I will demonstrate a variety of my skills and education. I am open-minded, stoic, eager to learn, and reliable. As of right now, I am the head of physical security at an Amazon distribution center through Allied Universal, I just completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification, and am preparing to take the CompTIA Security+. I am combining my security career with my passion for technology to build myself into a cybersecurity analyst capable of complying with federal and security framework protocols, mitigating risks, containing threats, resolving incidents, and improving myself through the experience I gain.
