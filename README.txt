Hi, my name is Jacob and welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio; a comprehensive exemplar of my information technology and security backgrounds. Here I will demostrate a variety of my skills and education. I am eager to learn as much as I can, open-minded, stoic, and reliable. As of right now, I am the head of physical security at an Amazon distribution center, I just completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification, and am preparing to take the CompTIA Security+. I am combining my security career with my passion for technology to build myself into a cybersecurity analyst capable of being a valuable asset for my upcoming employer.
