# cybersecurity-portfolio
Hi, my name is Jacob and welcome to my cyber security portfolio; a comprehensive exemplar of my information technology and security backgrounds. 
Here I will demostrate a variety of my skills and education. As of right now, I am the head of physical security at an Amazon distribution center, I 
just completed the Google Cyber Security Professional Certification, and am preparing to take the CompTIA Security+. I am combining my security
career with my passion for technology to build myself into a valuable asset for my upcoming employer.
